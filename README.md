## Documentation for Business Card

This code was created in order present a business card in an online format. 

The background element was created using key frames to move shapes up the y-axis before slowly disappearing. These keyframes were also used in the actual card element to tranform an image to the left before looping. This looping is done smoothly so it remains unnoticed.
The grid aspect was difficult as it required many grids inside one another, this often created problems when it came to placing elements inside each individual grid.
